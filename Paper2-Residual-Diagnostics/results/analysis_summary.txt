PAPER 2: RESIDUAL ANALYSIS SUMMARY REPORT
The Revelatory Division - Testing the Hypothesis
======================================================================

TEST 1: RESIDUAL DISTRIBUTION DIFFERENCES
----------------------------------------
  Residuals with different distributions: 3/6
  Residuals with different locations: 2/6
  → FINDING: Residuals contain group-discriminating information

TEST 2: U-SHAPE DETECTION
----------------------------------------
  Significant U-shapes detected: 7/24
  Patterns found:
    - HOMA_IR vs Glucose: U-shape
    - HOMA_IR vs Insulin: U-shape
    - LAR vs Insulin: Inverted-U
    - MCP1_Adiponectin vs Glucose: U-shape
    - Leptin_BMI vs Age: U-shape
    - Leptin_BMI vs Insulin: Inverted-U
    - Glucose_Insulin vs Insulin: U-shape
  → FINDING: Non-linear patterns exist in residuals

TEST 3: CLASSIFICATION IMPROVEMENT
----------------------------------------
  AUC improvement from adding residuals: -0.024
  Statistical significance: p = 0.3577
  → FINDING: No improvement from adding residuals

======================================================================
OVERALL CONCLUSION
======================================================================
The hypothesis receives PARTIAL SUPPORT.
Some evidence suggests residuals contain information, but findings are mixed.

Note: This is exploratory research on a small dataset (N=116).
Findings require replication on larger, independent datasets.

1. METABOLIC SYNDROME DISTRIBUTION
----------------------------------------
   Overall MetS prevalence: 12.3%
   Gray zone (2-3 components): 27.1%

2. RESIDUALS BY MetS STATUS
----------------------------------------
   Location differences: 17/17
   Shape differences: 17/17
   Top findings:
     - MetS_Count: d = 2.956, p = 0.0000
     - NFS: d = 0.946, p = 0.0000
     - TyG: d = 0.937, p = 0.0000

3. RESIDUALS BY COMPONENT COUNT
----------------------------------------
   Group differences: 17/17
   Non-linear patterns: 16/17

4. GRAY ZONE DISCRIMINATION
----------------------------------------
   Ratios only: AUC = 0.738
   Residuals only: AUC = 0.673
   Combined: AUC = 0.754
   Improvement: +0.016 AUC

INTERPRETATION
======================================================================

The metabolic syndrome represents a cluster of interrelated risk factors.
The 'gray zone' (2-3 components) is clinically important because:
  - These patients are at the diagnostic boundary
  - Standard criteria give ambiguous guidance
  - Progression risk varies substantially

If residuals improve discrimination in the gray zone, it suggests that:
  - The standard component count misses hidden metabolic dysfunction
  - Residual patterns may identify different MetS subtypes
  - Personalized risk stratification may be possible

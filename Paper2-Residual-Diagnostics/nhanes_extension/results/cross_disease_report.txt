EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------

This analysis tests whether the Revelatory Division principle
generates UNIVERSAL patterns across disease categories, or
whether findings are disease-specific.

1. CROSS-DISEASE RESIDUAL CORRELATIONS
----------------------------------------
   Cross-category correlations tested: 90
   Significant (p < 0.001): 70
   Strong (|r| > 0.3): 14

   Interpretation: Correlated residuals suggest shared
   underlying mechanisms not captured by individual ratios.

2. UNIVERSAL RESIDUAL PATTERNS
----------------------------------------
   Residuals tested: 17
   Universal (≥3 diseases): 12

   Universal residuals:
     - eGFR: 5/5 diseases
     - ACR: 5/5 diseases
     - FIB4: 4/5 diseases
     - DeRitis: 4/5 diseases
     - NFS: 4/5 diseases
     - G_I: 4/5 diseases
     - MetS_Count: 4/5 diseases
     - QUICKI: 4/5 diseases
     - LDL_HDL: 4/5 diseases
     - WHtR: 3/5 diseases
     - APRI: 3/5 diseases
     - TC_HDL: 3/5 diseases

   Interpretation: Universal residuals may capture fundamental
   metabolic dysfunction that manifests across disease categories.

3. U-SHAPE PATTERN CONSISTENCY
----------------------------------------
   Significant quadratic patterns: 52/94
   U-shapes (a > 0): 14/52

   Interpretation: Consistent U-shapes across diseases would
   support the QO+R framework's prediction of regime transitions.

4. COMORBIDITY PATTERNS
----------------------------------------
   HOMA_IR: H = 31.75, p = 0.0000 ***
   TG_HDL: H = 161.24, p = 0.0000 ***

   Interpretation: Residuals that differ by comorbidity count
   may reflect cumulative metabolic dysfunction.

CONCLUSIONS
======================================================================

The cross-disease analysis tests the core prediction of the
Revelatory Division: that residuals reveal UNIVERSAL patterns
of metabolic dysfunction, not just disease-specific noise.

If confirmed, this suggests:
  1. Clinical ratios share a common mathematical structure
  2. Residuals capture shared pathophysiology
  3. The QO+R framework may have broad applicability

Limitations:
  - Cross-sectional data cannot prove causation
  - Shared confounders may drive apparent correlations
  - Validation in independent datasets required
